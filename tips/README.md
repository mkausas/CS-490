# Pre-work - Tipster

Tipster is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Marty Kausas

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] UI animations
* [X] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.
^ Chose not to have it ALWAYS on because I use all of the screen realestate with more items

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Ability to select the type of person you are tipping
- [X] Splits the bill for up to three people
- [X] home screen tells you who you are tipping
- [X] App Icon
- [X] Splash Screen

## Notes

Review of basic Swift language and iOS complexities. Tough making design look good and figuring out what should be in the settings page.
